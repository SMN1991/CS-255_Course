# CS-255_Course 

Portfolio for SNHU's CS-255 System Analysis and Design, taken Jan. - Feb. 2022, focused on the analysis and design of systems.


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

The client for the DriverPass project was the company DriverPass. They wanted a web-based service to supply vehicle driver training, with a combination of in-person training sessions and online training and testing. 


What did you do particularly well? 

I believe I did the diagram design particularly well. I feel like I am skilled in translating information into different forms and enjoy the visual design element of diagrams. 


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? 
    
While I feel I did well on diagrams, the sequence diagram is something I was not happy with. I would like to, and plan on, doing additional research on this diagram type to see other ways they are designed. In mine I have several nested branches but feel like they all seem one giant piece, rather than multiple nested ones.  


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
    
The interview transcript was exceptionally detailed. The client in that transcript had a promising idea of what they wanted and had ideas on how to accomplish those goals. Translating those wants and goals into the functional and non-functional requirements in addition to the purpose and goals of the project were instrumental in my completing the various diagram design in addition to the System design document and business requirements document. 

  
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

Laying out a project in the terms we learned in this class - such as purpose, objectives and goals, functional and non-functional requirements, and limitations - has given me some insight into some project I have had kicking around my head for some time but have been unable to articulate into an actual design. The UML diagrams we learned about in this class, along with my previous class where I learned some UML design, will help me move forward on those projects, which I hope to someday feature on my GitHub portfolio.
